    <ul>
        <li>6 large sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 tbs vanilla extract</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into slices.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a heavy skillet and add the sliced sweet potatoes.</li>
        <li>Mix the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Cover the sweet potatoes with sugar mixture and stir. Cover skillet, reduce heat to low and cook for about 1 hour or until potatoes are "candied". They should be tender but a little hard around the edges. Also the sauce will turn dark. You will need to stir occasionally during the cooking. Stir in the vanilla just before serving. Serve hot.</li>
